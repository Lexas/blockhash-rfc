This document describes a URN namespace for identifying images by
their likeness, encoded as a perceptual hash based on the image
content.  The naming scheme relies on an algorithm called blockhash.
The hash is easy to compute but still has a high probability of
positively identifying an image after it has been shared through
various Internet services, which typically strip other identifying
metadata.
